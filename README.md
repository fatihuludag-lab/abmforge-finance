# ABMForge-Finance

[![CI](https://github.com/fatihuludag-lab/abmforge-finance/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fatihuludag-lab/abmforge-finance/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

`abmforge-finance` is an independent, research-oriented Python extension for
building financial market simulations on top of
[ABMForge](https://github.com/fatihuludag-lab/abmforge).

The finance domain engine will remain independent from ABMForge. ABMForge-specific
behavior will be isolated in an adapter layer, allowing the order book, matching,
clearing, accounting, policy, recording, and validation components to be tested as
ordinary Python modules.

## Project status

The project is in its package-bootstrap phase. This branch establishes packaging,
typing, tests, CI, citation metadata, and the compatibility contract. It deliberately
does **not** yet implement orders, traders, an exchange, a limit order book, or RL
environments.

## Planned research scope

The first research core will support a single risky asset, a central exchange, a
price-time-priority limit order book, deterministic discrete-time execution,
baseline behavioral trading policies, fixed pretrained RL policies, multi-seed
experiments, financial metrics, and bounded-memory research artifacts.

A primary research question is how increasing the share of reinforcement-learning
traders changes volatility, liquidity, price efficiency, tail risk, resilience,
wealth distribution, and systemic fragility.

## Installation

The current package is intended for development use.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows PowerShell: .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Quality checks

```bash
python -m ruff format --check src tests
python -m ruff check src tests
python -m mypy src tests
python -m pytest --cov=abmforge_finance --cov-report=term-missing
python -m build
python -m twine check dist/*
```

## Compatibility policy

The bootstrap package supports Python 3.10 through 3.13 and declares compatibility
with `abmforge>=0.3.0a1,<0.4`.

CI validates two ABMForge lines:

1. the released `abmforge` dependency selected by the package metadata;
2. the audited ABMForge `main` commit recorded in
   `constraints/abmforge-main.txt`.

Published research must record both package versions and exact source commit hashes.
ABMForge is alpha-stage software, so semantic-version compatibility alone is not a
complete reproducibility record.

## Architecture decisions

Architecture Decision Records are stored under [`docs/adr`](docs/adr).

## Development workflow

Work is developed through small branches with tests and quality checks in the same
pull request. The initial sequence is:

```text
chore/bootstrap-package
feat/domain-primitives
feat/limit-order-book
feat/matching-engine
feat/clearing-portfolio
feat/finance-recorder
feat/abmforge-adapter
```
